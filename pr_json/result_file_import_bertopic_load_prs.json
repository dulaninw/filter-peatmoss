        "PR Comment": "@linxule Thanks for sharing your use cases and suggestions! \n\n> I am following up on the use of seed_words in bertopic.vectorizer.ClassTfidfTransformer. I have a particular interest in refining the handling of seed words and their variants, such as \"budget\" and \"budgeting\".\n> \n> My query revolves around the potential for regex pattern matching to group similar seed words, avoiding stemming or lemmatization of the original text, which might lead to loss of meaning or contextual ambiguity. \n\nThe way `seed_words` is currently handled is by taking the IDF values and multiplying them by a user-defined value. That way, the user can control the degree to which the `seed_words` impact the resulting topic representations. However,  the `ClassTfidfTransformer` is actually not the one handling the words themselves, merely the bag-of-word representations. As a result, the vocabulary is created through the `CountVectorizer` before passing the bag-of-words, not the vocabulary, to the `ClassTfidfTransformer`. \n\nIn other words, the `ClassTfidfTransformer` does not actually have access as of yet to the vocabulary. Of course, it is possible to give it that but I am not sure whether we should since parsing the vocabulary is the task of the tokenizer not necessarily the weighting mechanism.\n\nAnother approach would be to run one of the examples you mentioned yourself on the input data with the `CountVectorizer` and parse the vocabulary before passing it back to a new `CountVectorizer`. It actually has a `vocabulary` parameter, so you could parse it yourself with whatever method suits your use case.\n\nNote that this method allows you to group the vocabulary before passing it to BERTopic. If we were to implement it within `ClassTfidfTransformer`, it would have to be re-calculated each time you run BERTopic.\n\nHaving said that, let me briefly go through the examples you mentioned.\n\n> Regex Pattern Matching: Could regex pattern matching be implemented within ClassTfidfTransformer to efficiently group seed words such as \"budget\" and \"budgeting\" without reducing them to their root forms through preprocessing?\n\nAs mentioned above, I am not sure it should be implemented within `ClassTfidfTransformer` but for the sake of simplicity let's assume it could be. Using regex on potentially millions of tokens is quite the task and something that can take quite a while. Therefore, doing this before running BERTopic would be preferred. \n\n> Alternative Stemming Method: As an alternative, what are your thoughts on stemming an extensive list of English words to identify groups that share the same root? This could automate the grouping of similar seed words but may raise concerns regarding practicality and computational efficiency.\n\nNote that whatever method you choose, you are likely still parsing a large vocabulary which could be feasible if you select a subset of that vocabulary, for instance by choosing words that only appear at least *n* times. Stemming is a great option but since the stemmed words are semantically similar, using something like [MaximalMarginalRelevance](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/representation/representation.html#maximalmarginalrelevance) seems more appropriate to reduce words with similar meaning.\n\n> Leveraging Synonyms and Antonyms: Additionally, would integrating external resources like WordNet from NLTK to find synonyms and antonyms be advisable for a broader semantic understanding in BERTopic?\n\nThis does not have a yes or no answer and depends highly on your use case but external resources could indeed help finding synonyms and antonyms. However, as mentioned above, removing similar words seems like a job for [MaximalMarginalRelevance](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/representation/representation.html#maximalmarginalrelevance). \n\nAll in all, I would advise doing this grouping first and then supplying the grouped words to the `vocabulary` parameter in the `CountVectorizer`. That seems the most efficient route.",

I could imagine that things like the number of topics, number of training docs etc., could all be of interest. \n\n- Creating a template model card, i.e. something like (https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md).

These embeddings will be compared with the existing document embeddings through cosine similarity and assigned a label. If the document is most similar to a seeded topic, then it will get that topic's label. If it is most similar to the average document embedding, it will get the -1 label. These labels are then passed through UMAP to create a semi-supervised approach that should nudge the topic creation to the seeded topics.\n> \n> Second, we take all words in `seed_topic_list` and assign them a multiplier larger than 1. Those multipliers will be used to increase the IDF values of the words across all topics thereby increasing the likelihood that a seeded topic word will appear in a topic. This does, however, also increase the chance of an inrelevant topic having unrelated words. In practice, this should not be an issue since the IDF value is likely to remain low regardless of the multiplier. The multiplier is now a fixed value but may change to something more elegant, like taking the distribution of IDF values and its position into account when defining the multiplier.\n> \n> ## Fixes\n> * Fix loading pre-trained BERTopic model\n> * Fix mapping of probabilities\n\nHi, thanks for the update.\nCan we decide how many documents we would like to get from this method? For instance, instead of 3 documents, could we get X number of documents. As an example, a kind of method like this: topic_model.get_representative_docs(topic=1, nr_of_documents_returned=20).",

I could imagine that things like the number of topics, number of training docs etc., could all be of interest. \n\n- Creating a template model card, i.e. something like (https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md). This can be helpful as a starting point for a model card structure even if most sections are not completed. \n\nI think this can all come later, and happy to help with this part if you think it might interest you.

        "PR Comment": "Hi Maarten,\n\nI am following up on the use of `seed_words` in `bertopic.vectorizer.ClassTfidfTransformer`.

        "PR Comment": "@linxule Thanks for sharing your use cases and suggestions! \n\n> I am following up on the use of seed_words in bertopic.vectorizer.ClassTfidfTransformer. I have a particular interest in refining the handling of seed words and their variants, such as \"budget\" and \"budgeting\".\n> \n> My query revolves around the potential for regex pattern matching to group similar seed words, avoiding stemming or lemmatization of the original text, which might lead to loss of meaning or contextual ambiguity. \n\nThe way `seed_words` is currently handled is by taking the IDF values and multiplying them by a user-defined value. That way, the user can control the degree to which the `seed_words` impact the resulting topic representations. However,  the `ClassTfidfTransformer` is actually not the one handling the words themselves, merely the bag-of-word representations. As a result, the vocabulary is created through the `CountVectorizer` before passing the bag-of-words, not the vocabulary, to the `ClassTfidfTransformer`. \n\nIn other words, the `ClassTfidfTransformer` does not actually have access as of yet to the vocabulary. Of course, it is possible to give it that but I am not sure whether we should since parsing the vocabulary is the task of the tokenizer not necessarily the weighting mechanism.\n\nAnother approach would be to run one of the examples you mentioned yourself on the input data with the `CountVectorizer` and parse the vocabulary before passing it back to a new `CountVectorizer`. It actually has a `vocabulary` parameter, so you could parse it yourself with whatever method suits your use case.\n\nNote that this method allows you to group the vocabulary before passing it to BERTopic. If we were to implement it within `ClassTfidfTransformer`, it would have to be re-calculated each time you run BERTopic.\n\nHaving said that, let me briefly go through the examples you mentioned.\n\n> Regex Pattern Matching: Could regex pattern matching be implemented within ClassTfidfTransformer to efficiently group seed words such as \"budget\" and \"budgeting\" without reducing them to their root forms through preprocessing?\n\nAs mentioned above, I am not sure it should be implemented within `ClassTfidfTransformer` but for the sake of simplicity let's assume it could be. Using regex on potentially millions of tokens is quite the task and something that can take quite a while. Therefore, doing this before running BERTopic would be preferred. \n\n> Alternative Stemming Method: As an alternative, what are your thoughts on stemming an extensive list of English words to identify groups that share the same root? This could automate the grouping of similar seed words but may raise concerns regarding practicality and computational efficiency.\n\nNote that whatever method you choose, you are likely still parsing a large vocabulary which could be feasible if you select a subset of that vocabulary, for instance by choosing words that only appear at least *n* times. Stemming is a great option but since the stemmed words are semantically similar, using something like [MaximalMarginalRelevance](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/representation/representation.html#maximalmarginalrelevance) seems more appropriate to reduce words with similar meaning.\n\n> Leveraging Synonyms and Antonyms: Additionally, would integrating external resources like WordNet from NLTK to find synonyms and antonyms be advisable for a broader semantic understanding in BERTopic?\n\nThis does not have a yes or no answer and depends highly on your use case but external resources could indeed help finding synonyms and antonyms. However, as mentioned above, removing similar words seems like a job for [MaximalMarginalRelevance](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/representation/representation.html#maximalmarginalrelevance). \n\nAll in all, I would advise doing this grouping first and then supplying the grouped words to the `vocabulary` parameter in the `CountVectorizer`. That seems the most efficient route.",

Perhaps a quick fix can be to use a stacked bar chart and show all columns?\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-10 at 17 48 04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29844253/201169349-13dc6046-d4a7-4431-9437-e3ae2bb02c66.png)\n\n### Adding an extra pattern\nThis is not a bug, but I wondered if we could add another pattern to the list of automatically generated patterns - I would like to see a variation of noun phrase where the search terms is in the front.\n\nSo, for example, at the moment, if I search for 'obesity' I'll have things like \"adult obesity\" and \"childhood obesity\".\n\nHowever, I would also like to find things like \"obesity crisis\" or \"obesity pandemic\"\n\nI think this could be relatively easily done by swapping a few lines for the very first pattern? eg, perhaps something like...\n```\n[ {'TEXT': 'obesity'},\n  {'POS': 'NOUN'},\n  {'POS': 'NOUN', 'OP': '?'},\n]\n```\n\nYou can also imagine examples with \"food\" like \"food preparation\", \"food insecurity\", \"food poverty\" etc.\n\n### BERTopic visualisation: hover data\nI realise this comes \"out of the box\" and perhaps we can't change anything, but maybe it's possible to:\n- Add year to the hover-over data\n- Break long sentences into multiple lines\nHowever, it might be the case that it's not possible without changing BERTopic library itself (which we don't want to do here).\n\n### BERTopic visualisation: topics\nI'm a bit confused about why there are different number of topics in the first and second graph... does it just limit the bar chart graph to 8? It's also a bit annoying that the colours don't match between both, but that's a very minor issue.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-10 at 18 02 53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29844253/201172231-e874c4d8-8afc-4a88-a3e4-28c12716bea4.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-10 at 18 03 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29844253/201172278-4f8c2aad-14ba-4083-99bd-c90b9a991eb7.png)\n",

If you run `plot_mentions(use_documents=False)`, it will produce a stacked bar chart.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-12 at 21 40 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47244945/201474367-16df1d92-bdda-4cc0-9880-cd0959e7ad53.png)\n\n\nIf you run `plot_mentions(use_documents=True)`, it will produce a regular bar chart as `document_mentions` only shows total mentions, it does not separate the mentions by different search terms.\n\n",

        "PR Comment": "> ### BERTopic visualisation: topics\n> I'm a bit confused about why there are different number of topics in the first and second graph... does it just limit the bar chart graph to 8? It's also a bit annoying that the colours don't match between both, but that's a very minor issue.\n> \n\n`visualize_barchart` has a parameter `top_n_topics` which defaults to 8.\n\nI have set the notebook cell to now use `visualize_barchart(top_n_topics=len(set(topic_model.topics_)))` so that it shows all the topics.\n\nI couldn't see any options in BERTopic to change the colour palette.\n\n\n",

When the plot is larger it allows for longer sentences to be displayed. I have increased the size of the plot in the demo notebook and added a note relating to these parameters for users.",
